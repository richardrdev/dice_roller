# dice-roller
###### A react app for simulating dice rolls.
&nbsp;

### About
This is a webapp that simulates dice rolls of various sizes and complexities.  Originally created as a small demo to practice React skills and learn Sass, I decided to flesh this out into a full project.  The bulk of the project was made during May 2020.

&nbsp;

### Features

8 standard dice sizes (two-sided through twenty-sided)

Responsive, mobile-friendly design

Support for custom, user-generated rolls.

Supports complex rolls:  User can specify dice size, number of dice, modifier to add/subtract after roll, and number of times to perform the roll.
